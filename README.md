Testing
---------

Tests are running with `mocha` and `node-ts`. Simply run with :

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test-bail
```


`node-ts` has a few quirks, for an explanation of how the command is ran look [there](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node#mocha) and [there](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node#help-my-types-are-missing).
